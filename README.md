 Like Napster but with smart contracts for ownership & micropayments.
How it Works:
	1.	Users upload their music files.
	2.	A smart contract records ownership & licensing.
	3.	Other users can stream or download by paying micro-fees in crypto.
	4.	Artists get rewarded in tokens (instead of relying on a music label).

ðŸ”¥ Tech Stack:
	â€¢	Solana or Ethereum smart contracts for payments.
	â€¢	Arweave or IPFS for storing music files.
	â€¢	Node.js & Web3.js for frontend interaction.
